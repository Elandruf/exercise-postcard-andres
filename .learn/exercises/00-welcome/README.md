# Welcome!

Welcome to your Digital Postcard Project 🖖🧑‍💻

## 💬 Fundamentals:

We have prepared a series of exercises where you will practice everything you have learned so far about HTML and CSS.

1. Create a basic `HTML` structure.

2. Use previously seen tags from scratch.

3. Connect stylesheets.

4. Apply different styles with `CSS` to spice up your project.

5. Manage `<divs>`.
