# `11.1` Header Content

Now it is time to include our content inside the `.postcard-header` div.

The `postcard-header` contains one title on the left and one image on the right.

What HTML `<tags>` do you think we should use to represent a title and an image? 🤔

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Add a `<h1>` tag inside the content of `.postcard-header` with the text **"My Postcard"** (make sure the **h1** contains the desired title for the postcard).

2. Add a `<img>` tag inside the same `<div>`, the **image** and the **h1** must be siblings (immediate children of the `.postcard-header`)

3. Make the image have this URL:

```text

```

## Expected Result:

- If you `build` your page, it should look like this:

## 💡 Hint:

- Don't forget that the **black background** and **red border** are only temporary guides to better differentiate our components, don't focus on them, they will be removed later.
