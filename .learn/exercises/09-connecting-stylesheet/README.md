# `09` Connecting Stylesheet

In your `styles.css` file we have specified that we want the `body` of the website to be black. If we want it to work, we must connect that file to the `index.html` file, using the `<link>` tag.

> `<link>` tags are the only way to connect **CSS** Stylesheets with **HTML** files.

## üìù Instructions:

1. Add the following code inside the opening and closing `<head></head>` tags:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
```
## üí° Hint:

+ If the connection between CSS and HTML was successful, your website should be **black** after you build.
