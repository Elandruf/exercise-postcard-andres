# `11` Postcard Divisions

Now we have to keep building the strategy for our HTML, we have to continue dividing the postcard in pieces to be able to apply styles and control it easily.

![Postcard Divisions](../../assets/11-postcard-divisions.gif?raw=true)

## 📝 Instructions:

 1. Inside your `<div class="postcard">` add three additional divs.

```txt
1. .postcard
    1.1. .postcard-header
    1.2. .postcard-body
    1.3. .postcard-footer
```
>Note: All three of them are immediate children.

## 💡 Hint:

+ Please make sure the divs have the specified classes, the first of the 3 divs should have the class `postcard-header`, the second one `postcard-body` and the third one `postcard-footer`.

## 🔎 Important:

+ You don't have to include the dot symbol (`.`) in your class name, you will only use the dots in the CSS.
