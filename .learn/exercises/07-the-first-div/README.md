# `07` The first div

Now that we have our basic structure, it is time to add our first element inside the `<body>` tags.

Most of the time, the first element inside the `<body>` is a `<div>`, (div stands for division). Basically, they are great tools to split your website into several sections.

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Add a new `<div>` between the opening and closing `<body>` tags, like this:

```html
<body>
    <div class="postcard">Hello</div>
</body>
```

## 💡 Hints:

+ The `<div>` you added must have the `class="postcard"`, because that is how we are going to refer to it later, it is like assigning a name to the HTML element for later modification.

+ Make sure the `<div>` tag is closed.

+ Also make sure to write the word `Hello` between the opening and closing `<body>` tags.
