# `06` Let's start building

It's time to start building your Postcard!

All websites need a basic HTML template that includes a `<body>`, `<head>`, etc. 

## 📝 Instructions: 

1. Delete all the previous content inside the `index.html` and paste this code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- start adding new tags here -->
</body>
</html>
```

## 💡 Hint:

+ Every website starts with this skeleton. If you `build` your website you'll see that it is white (empty), but only because the `<head>` is invisible to the website user, only the tags you add to the `<body>` are visible to all.
