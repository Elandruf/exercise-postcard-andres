### To better understand and identify the Tags:

> Think for a moment about a text document in Microsoft Word. There is an HTML `<tag>` for almost anything you can do in it: paragraphs, strong or italic text, headings, images, etc.

## üìù Instructions:

1. Memorize the 6 most important HTML `<tags>` and what they do: 

| Tag                   | Usage                 |
| -----------------     | --------------------- |
| `<p>`                 | for paragraphs        |
| `<button>`            | for buttons           |
| `<img>`               | for images            |
| `<h1>` `<h2>` `<h3>`  | titles (headings),  where `h1` is the biggest, and `h6` the smallest |
| `<div>`               | split your website in squares (boxes)  |
| `<input>`             | allows visitors to input information  |
