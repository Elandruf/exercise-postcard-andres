# `08.1` Red Borders

To be able to debug better the application, we strongly recommend to include certain styles inside your `styles.css`.

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Copy and paste into your `styles.css` file, the following code:

```css
* {
	border: 1px dashed red;
	min-height: 10px;
}
```

## 💡 Hint:

+ This code is going to add a red dashed border to every element in the website, making them easier to see and debug.

## 🔎 Important:

+ This code will be removed once you finish your postcard.
